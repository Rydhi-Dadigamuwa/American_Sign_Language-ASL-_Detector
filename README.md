# Americal_Sign_Language-ASL-_Detector

This repository contains the code and resources for an American Sign Language (ASL) detector built using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. The detector is designed to recognize and classify hand signs representing English letters in real time.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for fast and accurate real-time detection of ASL hand signs.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Identifies and highlights ASL letters with bounding boxes.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Leverages OpenCV for video capture and image processing.
- **Customizable**: Easily retrain the model with new data or modify detection settings.


## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv8


If you want to train YOLOv8 on your own dataset use the jupyter notebook file in "YOLO_Model_Training" folder and use "Instructions.yaml" file
